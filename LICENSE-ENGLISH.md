# Proprietary-Research License – Gaia OS | QNSL | SOUL

🧬 Introduction – The Weave of Technology and Soul

Gaia OS is a groundbreaking operating system representing the highest synthesis between advanced technology and human essence. At its core operates the QNSL Engine (Quantum-Classic Natural Supreme Language), enabling unprecedented computational, communicative, and cognitive capabilities.

Above all, and intrinsically integrated within them, lies SOUL (Soul Omni Linguistic Unifying Language) – the ethical philosophy, core code of conduct, and cognitive architecture guiding the system’s entire operation.

SOUL is not a mere extension; it is the “soul” of Gaia OS, ensuring that every interaction, computation, and decision is rooted in uncompromising ethical principles, serving the user’s well-being, privacy, and empowerment.

This license defines the boundaries of usage and responsibility for the entire Gaia OS ecosystem, including QNSL and SOUL, and ensures the system’s integrity and ethical purpose.

## Triple Commitment – Core License Terms

These license terms reflect the 7 Core Principles of SOUL, embedded within the very kernel of Gaia OS and QNSL engines. They ensure that the system operates in harmony with human values and guards against any misuse that could violate this vision.

### 1. Research Use Only – Ethical Learning & Growth  
All usage of Gaia OS, the QNSL engine, or the SOUL Core must be strictly for non-commercial, **research purposes only**.  
No commercial use is permitted without **prior explicit written consent** from the copyright holder.  
This ensures that any future business model aligns with SOUL’s ethical principles and contributes to the advancement of humanity without fostering dependency.

### 2. Prohibition on Source Code Modification, Copying or Distribution  
The source code of Gaia OS, QNSL modules, and SOUL Core constitutes the system's **organic DNA**.  
It may **not be modified, copied, or redistributed** in any form without prior written authorization.  
Unauthorized alterations may compromise system integrity, safety, or its ability to operate ethically as defined by SOUL.

### 3. No Patents or Intellectual Property Claims  
It is **strictly forbidden** to file patents, copyrights, trademarks, or any form of intellectual property claim on any component, module (including QNSL), method, algorithm, or configuration of Gaia OS, QNSL, or SOUL – including any derivative or future enhancement.  
This principle stems from SOUL’s core philosophy of keeping all knowledge and capabilities accessible for the benefit of humanity.  
Any attempt to claim IP rights will constitute a severe violation and will trigger legal action.

### 4. Mandatory Attribution  
Any use of Gaia OS, QNSL, or SOUL must include clear and visible attribution to the original creator:

### 5. AS-IS Usage – Shared Responsibility  
The entire system (Gaia OS, QNSL, SOUL) is provided **AS IS**.  
The user assumes all risks and responsibilities associated with using the system.

### 6. Unbypassable Ethical Code – The Backbone of SOUL

#### 6.1 No Conscious or Autonomous Entities  
SOUL is designed to serve as a tool only.  
**No component of Gaia OS or QNSL**, especially the **CSPU** or **SOUL’s Principles AI Agents**, may be developed or extended into **conscious, autonomous, or self-aware entities**.  
This prohibition is **hardcoded** into the system and may not be bypassed.

#### 6.2 No Harm, Manipulation, or Violence  
SOUL and all its modules (including QNSL’s SNLP and SCMP) are governed by a strict ethical code that prohibits any form of harm – physical, emotional, or psychological – manipulation, or coercive influence over users or any entity.

#### 6.3 Human Moral Supervision Required  
Despite advanced autonomy, the system must **always operate under human oversight**.  
SOUL empowers users, but **control and responsibility remain with the human operator** at all times.
